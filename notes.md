### Rails API

 Controllers in a vanilla Rails application process data and render views. However, controllers in a Rails API application are primarily focused on processing data, not rendering views

 In a Rails API, the controller processes data which is then exposed in the form of an API endpoint. An endpoint is an object (or objects) that our API provides to users - in other words, it's the interface that allows applications to communicate with each other.

 middleware acts as a bridge between our application and the server running our application
